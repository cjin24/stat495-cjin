# Goals
My goals for this course are to delve deeper into statistical concepts by looking at applications of the material and utilizing analytical tools. I also look forward to producing a thorough, large-scale (relative to past stats assignments) project from beginning to end.

# Post-Graduation
After undergrad, I would like to work for a year or two, if possible. After that, I plan to return to graduate school for at least a master's degree, but all of these are very much just ideas still. I am also looking into the Fulbright Program as a possibility. I've made a career exploration appointment at the Loeb Center to better understand my options and the necessary timelines.

# Summer 2023
Over this past summer, I studied our planet's orbital debris environment through the lens of statistical modelling. This was sort of an odd pipe dream for me, because I've always loved space (who doesn't love space!) but haven't put in the time to pursue studying astronomy. So having the chance to apply exactly what I've been learning in the statistics classroom throughout these past semesters to a topic that I've enjoyed based purely on personal interest was a wonderful experience.
